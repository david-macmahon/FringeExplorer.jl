# FringeExplorer

Tools for exploring radio astronomy fringe rates and then some.

## Overview

Functions for computing delay and delay rate matrices:

- `hd2wdw`
- `hd2wdw!`
- `td2wdw`
- `td2wdw!`

Functions for dealing with radio telescope array metadata:

- `antpos`
- `telinfo`

Functions for converting between hour angle and time:

- `ha2t`
- `t2ha`

Functions for converting between spherical and Cartesian coordinates:

- `c2s`
- `s2c`

Function for computing coordinates around a spherical reference location:

- `beamrings`

Function to facilitate conversion between astrometric right
ascension/declination (α, δ) and observed hour angle/declination (h, δ):

- `radec2hadec`

## Notebooks

The notebooks are a mess right now.  Any help cleaning them up would be most
welcome.

## Tests

Need tests.
